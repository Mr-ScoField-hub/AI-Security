## Overview
Guardrail Sentinel is an AI-driven cybersecurity solution built to detect, classify, and mitigate prompt injection attacks in large language models (LLMs) and AI systems.

Prompt injection is one of the fastest-growing threats in AI — attackers exploit model trust, manipulate responses, or extract confidential data. Guardrail Sentinel uses machine learning to identify malicious prompt patterns before they cause harm, turning reactive defense into proactive protection.

Built during the Cybersecurity Hackathon in VS Code, the system embeds core CIAC principles and a secure multi-layered architecture to ensure trustworthy AI deployment.

## Challenge Alignment
- **Hackathon Track:** Adaptive Threat Intelligence: AI for Proactive Security  
- **Focus Area:** Threat detection and prevention using AI/ML

How Guardrail Sentinel maps to the objective:
- Threat Detection — AI/ML identifies prompt injection attempts in real time
- Data Privacy & Encryption — All scanned data encrypted (AES-256) and anonymized
- AI in Cybersecurity — Uses NLP models for malicious intent recognition
- Secure Architecture — Zero-trust data flow, RBAC, and secure model inference

---

## Core Concept
"If AI can be attacked through language, then AI must defend through understanding."

Guardrail Sentinel is a machine learning-powered firewall for language models, continuously monitoring prompts for malicious intent, data exfiltration patterns, and hidden attack payloads.

---

## Key Features
1. AI-Powered Prompt Injection Detection
   - Fine-tuned transformer models (BERT + GPT embeddings) classify prompts as:
     - Safe
     - Suspicious
     - Malicious
   - Detects: jailbreak attempts, recursive instructions, context leaks, hidden prompt layering.

2. Adaptive Threat Intelligence Engine
   - Continuous training from attack logs and feedback loops
   - Pattern clustering to discover evolving injection techniques
   - Risk scoring with model confidence metrics

3. Secure Guardrail Architecture
   - Confidentiality: Encrypted input/output streams (AES-256 + HTTPS/TLS 1.3)
   - Integrity: Prompt hashing and signature validation to prevent tampering
   - Availability: Redundant scanning nodes and load balancing
   - Compliance: GDPR-ready anonymization and audit trail logging

4. Proactive Protection Mode
   - Predictive ML models forecast likely injection strategies
   - Auto-mitigation: prompt rewriting, sandbox blocking
   - Middleware integration with LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

5. Ethical AI & Transparency
   - Explainable decisions with “Why This Prompt Was Blocked” logs
   - Responsible disclosure workflow for researchers
   - Alignment with the NIST AI Risk Management Framework

## Usage & Integration

Middleware pattern (conceptual) for integrating with LLM APIs:

```python
# Conceptual FastAPI middleware snippet
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from guardrail_sentinel.detector import PromptDetector

app = FastAPI()
detector = PromptDetector(model="path/to/finetuned-classifier")

@app.post("/llm-proxy")
async def llm_proxy(request: Request):
    payload = await request.json()
    prompt = payload.get("prompt", "")
    result = detector.classify(prompt)
    if result.label == "malicious":
        # Block or rewrite
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail=result.explain())
    elif result.label == "suspicious":
        # Apply mitigation: rewrite, rate-limit, or sandbox
        prompt = detector.rewrite(prompt)
    # Forward to downstream LLM API
    response = await forward_to_llm_api(prompt)
    return response
```

Integration points:
- Pre-inference middleware for third-party LLM calls
- CI pipeline scanner for model release checks
- Real-time endpoint protection as a gateway
